    "about": " Hi there! I'm Tia, a software engineer from Austin, TX.\n\n\n I have a passion for building innovative and impactful technology solutions. Currently, I've immersed myself as a Full Stack Developer trainee in NPower's Path2Tech Program, designed specifically for women of color in tech, to further my skills in both front and back end development.\n\n\nWith a bachelor's degree in computer science and a commitment to continuous learning, I am actively expanding my expertise through training and self-study Coursera courses. My drive comes from a desire to contribute to the advancement of technology and to be part of something greater than myselfâ€”building solutions that can make a meaningful difference.",
